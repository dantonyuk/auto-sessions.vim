*auto-sessions.txt*   Another session manager

INTRODUCTION                                    *auto-sessions*

The auto-sessions plugin is a automatic session manager that manages sessions
based on the environment. Currently, the only Git based environment is
supported. The session is stored based on the Git branch you work in.

                                                *g:auto_sessions_dir*
The directory of the session files can be changed by defining the value of
g:auto_sessions_dir variable:
>
        let g:auto_sessions_dir = '.sessions'
<
By default it's `.vim-sessions`.

                                                *g:auto_sessions_loaded*
The plugin can be easily disabled by setting g:auto_sessions_loaded variable
to 1 in your `.vimrc` script.
>
        " Not the plugin won't be loaded
        let g:auto_sessions_loaded = 1
<
By default it's `.vim-sessions`.
